          The Citizens Police Data Project houses police disciplinary information obtained from the City of Chicago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information and stories we have collected here are intended as a resource for public oversight. Our aim is to create a new model of accountability between officers and citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an evolving platform. We are constantly adding data, and we welcome questions, feedback, and collaboration.

          28,567 allegations of misconduct were filed against Chicago Police Department officers between March 2011 and September 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          Less than 2% of those complaints resulted in any discipline.

          Complaints are disproportionately filed against a small subset of the Chicago Police Department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat officers—those with 10 or more complaints—make up about 10% of the force but receive 30% of all complaints. They average 3.7x as many complaints per officer as the rest of the force.
